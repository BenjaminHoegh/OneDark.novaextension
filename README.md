# Atom One Dark theme for Nova

![alt text](https://github.com/BenjaminHoegh/OneDark.novaextension/raw/master/Images/extension/slice1.png)


## Instructions

Of course, you need to have [Nova](https://panic.com/nova) installed (FYI, it only works under macOS).

If you're a proud owner of Nova, you ought to be able to go to **Extensions > Extensions Library > Themes (tab)** and pick the theme from there.

If that doesn't work, just clone this project (or download it from the releases page), it'll magically turn into a 'component' thingy, and you can then double-click it to add this theme to Nova!

## Disclaimer

[Nova](https://panic.com/nova) is the upcoming new editor from [Panic Inc](https://panic.com)., currently in private beta development.

Please take into account that I hardly know what I'm doing. Hope it works for you. This is being released for the sole purpose of testing how designing themes for Nova work; no infringements are intended; also, I might be tweaking this theme frequently, as I start figuring out how the colour assignments actually work; thus, caveat utilitor.
